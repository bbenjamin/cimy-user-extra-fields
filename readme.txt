Add some useful fields to registration and user's info

== Description ==

WordPress is becoming more than ever a tool to open blog/websites and CMSs in an easier way. Users are increasing day by day; one of the limits however is the restricted and predefined fields that are available in the registered users profile: it is difficult for example to ask for the acceptance of "Terms and Conditions of Use" or "Permission to use personal data".

The plug-in adds two new menu voices in the admin for the administrator and two for users.

Two new menus are:

    * “Users -> A&U Extended” lets you show users lists with the new fields that are created
    * “Options -> Cimy User Extra Fields” lets administrators add as many new fields as are needed to the users’ profile, giving the possibility to set some interesting rules.

Rules are:

    * max length admitted (only for text, textarea and password fields)
    * field needed (only for text, textarea and password fields)
    * check for e-mail address syntax (only for text, textarea and password fields)
    * field can be modified after the registration
    * field equal to some value (for example accept terms and conditions)
    * field hidden during registration

New fields will be visible in the profile and in the registration.

As for now the plug-in supports: text, textarea, password, checkbox, radio and drop-down fields, future versions can have more.
